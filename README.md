<p>
This is a Tetris clone called "Paultris" that I have created for windows in C++ using SDL2. It makes use of the SDL_image, SDL_TTF and SDL_mixer libraries.
This project was created using Visual Studio 2022.</p>

## How to play
<p>
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling tetrominoes inside the playing field. Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.
</p>
<p>
As lines are cleared, the level increases and tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.
